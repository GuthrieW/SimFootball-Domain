# SimFootball-Domain
Main hub for other stuff that goes on the main sim-football.com domain

gs folder contains the scripts behind the googledocs wiki template, in case anyone wants to make sure it's all good.

-------------------------------------

Should be able to upload this repo (except the gs folder) directly to the root directory of the domain and everything will be in its correct place. 

Additional checks might be necessary for other things like assets, etc.
